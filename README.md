# Helix: Spec-to-Prod Autobahn

## Introduction

Traditional software development is slow, manual, and full of handoffs: write a spec, code the interface, test, refactor, repeat—and every step risks losing context or introducing new bugs. Modern LLMs can help, but prompt-based workflows are brittle, and bots easily get lost without explicit structure.

Helix proposes a new approach: treat the development process as a guided, step-by-step playbook—where an LLM agent collaborates with engineers, tracks explicit progress, and always knows “where it is” in the journey from idea to production. The entire pipeline, from initial product narrative to passing tests and production deployment, is broken into small, auditable steps, each tracked by a progress beacon. Every change is tied to a living specification, and the bot’s reasoning—why it made certain changes—is logged and available for humans and for continuous model improvement.

By combining explicit step-tracking, rigorous spec-driven development, and automated, fine-tuned LLM workflows, Helix delivers faster iteration, higher reliability, and a permanent, self-improving record of every engineering decision.

## Automation Blueprint: “Spec-to-Prod Autobahn”

| Phase | What Happens | Guardrails |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| **1 — Playbook & Progress Beacon** | A machine-readable `playbook.yml` lists every step (`SPEC_DRAFT` → `DONE`) with exit conditions. Repo stores a progress beacon (file, tag, or commit prefix). | Pre-commit hook blocks any diff whose step label doesn’t match the beacon. |
| **2 — Living Spec (Source of Truth)** | LLM drafts `/spec.md` + changelog. Human tweaks → merge → tag `spec@hash`. | CI rejects code if commit header’s spec hash ≠ HEAD of spec. |
| **3 — Red-Bar e2e Test** | Bot generates high-level end-to-end spec that fails (proves nothing exists). | Exit only when failing reason is missing impl, never flakiness. |
| **4 — Scaffold & Triangulate Downward** | For each playbook step: interface stub → green e2e → real domain logic + unit/property tests → swap stub adapters for real infra → perf/load tuning. | Each sub-step = atomic green commit, prefixed `STEP[3/7]`. CI enforces mutation score, perf budget, smoke tests. |
| **5 — Reasoned Amendments** | When tests fail due to wrong assumptions, bot opens “Spec Amendment PR” with spec diff, reason log, and regenerates affected tests/impl once approved. | Every amendment auto-creates an ADR file with a searchable history of “why.” |
| **6 — Commit Discipline** | Conventional commit headers (`spec!`, `feat`, `fix`), body template with Why / Change / Validation sections and test stats. | Hook ensures diff touches only the layer allowed by the current playbook step. |
| **7 — Continuous Fine-Tuning** | Nightly (or streaming) job ingests spec-deltas, green commits, red→green patches. Uses structure-aware loss & contrastive pairs. | Eval harness compares pass-rate, diff size, human-review accept-rate before new weights go live. |
| **8 — Release & Flagging** | Final step flips feature flag in prod; monitoring + canary tests stay green → tag `release/X.Y.Z`. | Rollback = revert beacon, restore prior model tag, redeploy. |

## Net Effect

* Bot never gets lost — progress beacon + playbook keep it on rails.
* Every code move is audit-logged — tiny green commits, spec hashes, reasoning notes.
* Spec remains single source of truth — any contract shift starts there.
* Quality rises with usage — commits themselves feed the fine-tuning loop.

**Result:** an autonomous dev conveyor belt that ships features from narrative → spec → tests → prod with human review at the inflection points and a paper trail for everything.
