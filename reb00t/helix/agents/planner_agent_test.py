    ## Purpose
    Automate software development process

    ## Core Components
    1. **Living Specification** - Single source of truth for requirements
    2. **Progress Tracking** - Track development progress through steps
    3. **Agent System** - Automated development agent for code generation
    4. **Testing Framework** - Automated testing and validation

    ## Workflow
    ### A: Preparation
    1. Generate spec.md with requirements
    2. Generate progress.md with current state
    3. Generate basic system mockup
    4. Generate e2e test for system

    ## Invariants
    - The spec is the only source of truth
    - All changes must be tested

    1. **Living Specification** - Single source of truth for requirements, interfaces, invariants

    5. **CI/CD Integration** - CI enforces exit conditions for each playbook step
