# Spec: E2ETestDummy - Automated Spec-to-Production Software Development System

## Purpose

Automate the end-to-end software development process—from initial product idea through production deployment—by tightly coupling a stepwise playbook, a living specification, and an LLM agent capable of reasoning, code generation, test writing, and incremental learning. The system aims to maximize engineering velocity, reduce mistakes, and produce an auditable, continuously improving trail of engineering decisions.

## Core Components

1. **Living Specification (/docs/spec.md)**
   - Single source of truth for requirements, interfaces, invariants, and open questions.
   - Versioned with a content hash, referenced in every relevant commit.
   - Amended only via an explicit “spec amendment” process with reason logging.

2. **Playbook & Progress Beacon**
   - Machine-readable `playbook.yml` defines each phase (e.g. Spec Draft, E2E Test, Scaffold, Domain Logic, Infra Integration, Perf Budget, Done).
   - Current progress tracked by file (`progress.json`), git tag, or commit prefix.
   - Only one active step at a time; advancement gated by CI and step-specific exit conditions.

3. **Atomic, Always-Green Commits**
   - Each commit addresses a single playbook step and only advances when all relevant tests pass.
   - Commits are conventionally formatted, include spec hash and progress step, and log reasoning for the change.
   - Pre-commit and pre-push hooks enforce discipline and validate all constraints.

4. **LLM Agent (Bot)**
   - Reads the current spec, playbook step, and repo context.
   - Generates stubs, interfaces, tests, and real implementations as dictated by the current playbook step.
   - Proposes spec amendments with clear reasoning when implementation diverges from the spec or new requirements emerge.
   - Tracks and logs all actions, decisions, and justifications.

5. **CI/CD Integration**
   - CI enforces exit conditions for each playbook step.
   - Blocks progress or code merge if tests are failing, coverage is inadequate, mutation score drops, or progress beacon is out of sync.

6. **Reasoning Log & Architectural Decision Records (ADR)**
   - Every spec amendment and major design decision is logged (e.g. `/docs/adr/NNNN-why-X.md`), referencing the reason for change and its context.
   - This forms a historical, searchable trail of engineering intent.

7. **Continuous Model Fine-Tuning**
   - All commits, spec deltas, amendments, and test results are harvested as training data.
   - Nightly or streaming fine-tune jobs incrementally improve the LLM’s ability to operate within the playbook and reduce repeated mistakes.
   - Evaluated via an automated harness to prevent regressions.

## Workflow Overview

1. Product idea or requirement is added to the spec and approved.
2. Bot generates failing e2e test (“red bar”), scaffolds first stubs/interfaces.
3. Each playbook step: bot generates/tests/commits the minimal increment needed, with human review at inflection points.
4. When the spec is found to be incomplete/incorrect: bot opens a spec amendment PR, logs the reason, and awaits approval.
5. All changes are small, atomic, always-green, and tied to spec + step.
6. The process continues stepwise through the playbook until feature is deployed and monitored in prod.
7. Each cycle’s data is used to further fine-tune the LLM and improve the process.

## Invariants

- The spec is the only source of truth for requirements and contracts.
- No code or test is committed unless all relevant checks are green and commit metadata matches the current step and spec.
- All design/requirement changes are justified in writing and logged.
- The bot never skips steps; progress is only advanced by CI when exit conditions are satisfied.

## Open Questions / Extensibility

- How granular should the playbook steps be for your context (micro-commits vs. larger blocks)?
- What level of human review is required for spec amendments and at what steps is the process fully autonomous?
- Should LLM actions be signed/tagged distinctly from human ones for future analysis?
- What privacy/PII constraints are needed for harvesting training data?
